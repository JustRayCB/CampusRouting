"""
NOTE: Nodes Attributes:
    We can add a node and its attributes to the graph using the add_nodes_from method. 
    For example: G.add_nodes_from([(1, {"color": "blue"}), (2, {"color": "green"})])
    Then all the nodes will have the attribute color with the corresponding value.
    All the nodes do not need to have the same attributes.
NOTE: Edges Attributes:
    Using the add_edges_from method, we can add edges and their attributes to the graph. 
    For example: G.add_edges_from([(1, 2, {"weight": 3.1415}), (3, 4, {"weight": 2.718})])
WARNING: 
    If you add a node that is already in the graph, the attributes will be updated but not deleted or duplicated
    I assume it is the same for edges.
